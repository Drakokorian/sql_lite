# **Project: gosqlite - A Hyper-Scale, Hardened SQLite Driver for Go**

## **Mission**
To build a pure Go SQLite driver engineered for mission-critical, high-performance environments. The driver will be a secure, portable, and dependency-free component suitable for use in massively parallel, hyper-scale architectures.

## **Governing Pillars**
0. Must be built like an entrpirse porduct no excuses 

1.  **Hyper-Scale Architecture Support:**
    *   The driver is designed as a component for sharded, distributed systems.
    *   Features first-class support for WAL-based replication, enabling continuous data streaming and recovery.

2.  **Extreme Performance Optimizations:**
    *   **Asynchronous I/O:** Leverages advanced kernel interfaces on Linux for maximum throughput.
    *   **Vectorized Execution (SIMD):** The VDBE operates on batches of data for CPU-level parallelism.
    *   **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation:** Hot queries are compiled to native machine code.
    *   **Zero-Allocation Design:** A strict focus on minimizing memory allocations in hot paths.

3.  **Military-Grade Security & Reliability:**
    *   **Formal Verification:** Transaction logic will be mathematically proven correct using rigorous formal methods.
    *   **Fuzz Testing:** A continuous fuzzing suite will run against the parser to prevent security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Sandboxing:** A swappable, sandboxed VFS enforces the Principle of Least Privilege.
    *   **Secure Supply Chain:** Automated SBOM generation and vulnerability scanning.

4.  **Mission-Critical Delivery:**
    *   Every milestone is delivered as complete, production-ready code. **No stubs, no shortcuts, no deferred work.**

## **Coding Standards**

-   **Logging:** Logging must be implemented for all critical operations and errors, saved securely to an external text file. All logs and timestamps for all code should be UTC time.
-   **Mission-Critical Delivery:** Deliver each milestone as if it will go live in a mission-critical environment todayâ€”no shortcuts, no deferred work, no stubs, no scaffolding. Each increment must be real, working code that stands on its own in a modern enterprise context.
-   **Compatibility:** The driver must be compatible with SQLite versions from 2008 to the latest.
