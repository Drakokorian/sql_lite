# **Phase 7: Release (Hardened)**

**Primary Goal:** To finalize the driver with a secure supply chain and prepare for a robust, production-ready release.

### **Sprint 7.1: Secure Supply Chain & Release**

**Objective:** To automate the build and release process, ensuring the integrity, security, and transparency of the `gosqlite` driver binaries and source code.

#### **Component: Build & Release Pipeline (`build_release.go`)**

1.  **Automated Build Process:**
    *   **Reproducible Builds:** Implement a fully automated and reproducible build process to ensure that given the same source code, the same build environment, and the same build tools, the exact same binary is produced every time. This is crucial for verifying the integrity of releases.
    *   **Cross-Platform Compilation:** Configure the build pipeline to support cross-compilation for all target operating systems and architectures (e.g., Linux, Windows, macOS, ARM, x86).
    *   **Deterministic Dependencies:** Utilize Go Modules with `go.mod` and `go.sum` to ensure deterministic dependency resolution and prevent unexpected changes in transitive dependencies.
2.  **Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) Generation:**
    *   **Automated SBOM Creation:** Integrate tools into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically generate a comprehensive Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for every release. The SBOM will detail all direct and transitive dependencies, including their versions, licenses, and cryptographic hashes.
    *   **Standard Formats:** Generate SBOMs in industry-standard formats (e.g., SPDX, CycloneDX) to facilitate interoperability and automated analysis by consumers.
3.  **Vulnerability Scanning:**
    *   **Continuous Scanning:** Implement continuous vulnerability scanning of all direct and transitive dependencies. This will involve:
        *   **Dependency Analysis:** Regularly checking for known vulnerabilities in all third-party libraries and components used by the driver.
        *   **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** Running SAST tools against the `gosqlite` codebase to identify potential security flaws in the source code itself.
    *   **Reporting and Remediation:** Establish clear procedures for reporting, triaging, and remediating discovered vulnerabilities before release.
4.  **Secure Artifact Management:**
    *   **Digital Signatures:** Digitally sign all released binaries and artifacts using a trusted code signing certificate. This allows consumers to verify the authenticity and integrity of the released software.
    *   **Tamper Detection:** Implement mechanisms to detect any tampering with released artifacts, such as checksum verification.
    *   **Secure Storage:** Store release artifacts in secure, access-controlled repositories.
5.  **API Stability and Versioning:**
    *   **Semantic Versioning:** Adhere strictly to Semantic Versioning (Major.Minor.Patch) for all releases. This provides clear guidelines for API compatibility and allows consumers to manage dependencies effectively.
    *   **Public API Locking:** The v1.0.0 release will signify the locking of the public API. Subsequent releases will adhere to Go's compatibility promise, ensuring that existing code using the driver will not break with minor version updates.
6.  **Release Documentation:**
    *   **Release Notes:** Generate detailed release notes for each version, outlining new features, bug fixes, breaking changes, and known issues.
    *   **Installation and Usage Guides:** Provide comprehensive documentation for installing, configuring, and using the `gosqlite` driver.
    *   **Security Advisories:** Publish security advisories for any discovered vulnerabilities, including mitigation steps and affected versions.
