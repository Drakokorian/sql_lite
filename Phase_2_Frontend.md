# **Phase 2: The SQL Frontend (Hardened)**

**Primary Goal:** To build a secure, resilient, and fuzz-tested SQL parser.

### **Sprint 2.1: Zero-Trust Tokenizer & Parser**

**Objective:** To develop a robust and secure SQL tokenizer and parser that treats all input as potentially malicious, enforcing strict resource limits and validation rules.

#### **Component: Tokenizer (`tokenizer.go`)**

1.  **Lexical Analysis:** The tokenizer will perform lexical analysis, breaking down the raw SQL query string into a stream of tokens (e.g., keywords, identifiers, operators, literals).
2.  **Input Validation:**
    *   **Query Length Limits:** Enforce a maximum permissible length for incoming SQL queries to prevent buffer overflows and excessive memory allocation.
    *   **Character Set Validation:** Only allow a predefined set of valid characters to prevent injection of control characters or other malicious data.
3.  **Error Handling:** Provide precise error reporting for lexical errors, indicating the exact position and nature of the invalid token.

#### **Component: Parser (`parser.go`)**

1.  **Syntactic Analysis (AST Construction):** The parser will take the token stream from the tokenizer and construct an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representing the hierarchical structure of the SQL query.
2.  **Semantic Analysis:** Perform checks to ensure the query is semantically valid (e.g., correct number of arguments for functions, type compatibility).
3.  **Resource Limit Enforcement:**
    *   **Expression Depth Limits:** Restrict the maximum nesting depth of expressions (e.g., nested subqueries, complex `WHERE` clauses) to prevent stack overflows and excessive computation during query planning.
    *   **Number of Joins/Tables:** Limit the number of tables involved in a single query to prevent combinatorial explosion in query planning.
    *   **Memory Allocation Limits:** Implement mechanisms to monitor and limit memory consumption during AST construction and semantic analysis.
4.  **Zero-Trust Principles:**
    *   **Input Sanitization:** While the tokenizer handles initial character validation, the parser will continue to validate and sanitize all parsed elements, ensuring no malicious constructs can bypass the initial checks.
    *   **Strict Type Checking:** Enforce strict type compatibility rules to prevent unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities arising from type mismatches.
5.  **Error Handling:** Generate detailed and actionable error messages for syntax and semantic errors, aiding in debugging and preventing malformed queries from proceeding further.

### **Sprint 2.2: Fuzz Testing Framework**

**Objective:** To establish a continuous and comprehensive fuzz testing framework to proactively identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in the SQL parser and related components.

#### **Component: Fuzz Tester (`fuzz_test.go`)**

1.  **Fuzzing Harness Development:** Create a dedicated fuzzing harness that exposes the parser's input interfaces to the fuzzer. This harness will be responsible for:
    *   **Input Generation:** Generating a wide variety of syntactically valid, invalid, and malformed SQL queries. This includes random character sequences, edge cases, and mutations of known valid SQL.
    *   **Execution:** Feeding the generated inputs to the SQL parser and executing the parsing logic.
    *   **Monitoring for Anomalies:** Continuously monitoring the parser's behavior for:
        *   **Crashes/Panics:** Detecting unexpected program terminations.
        *   **Memory Leaks:** Identifying gradual increases in memory consumption that could indicate resource mismanagement.
        *   **Infinite Loops/Resource Exhaustion:** Detecting cases where the parser enters an endless loop or consumes excessive CPU/memory without terminating.
        *   **Incorrect Output:** Verifying that the parser's output (e.g., AST structure, error messages) is consistent with expectations, even for malformed inputs.
2.  **Coverage-Guided Fuzzing:** Implement coverage-guided fuzzing techniques to ensure that the fuzzer explores as many different code paths within the parser as possible. This involves:
    *   **Instrumentation:** Instrumenting the parser code to collect feedback on code coverage during fuzzing runs.
    *   **Feedback Loop:** Using coverage information to guide the fuzzer towards unexplored code paths, increasing the effectiveness of vulnerability discovery.
3.  **Corpus Management:** Maintain a corpus of interesting inputs that have triggered unique code paths or revealed bugs. This corpus will be used to seed future fuzzing runs and ensure regression testing.
4.  **Integration with CI/CD:** Integrate the fuzz testing suite into the continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to ensure that fuzzing runs automatically with every code change, providing continuous security assurance.
5.  **Reporting and Triage:** Establish a clear process for reporting and triaging issues discovered by the fuzzer, including detailed logs and reproducible test cases.
