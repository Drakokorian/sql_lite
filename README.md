# gosqlite - A Hyper-Scale, Hardened SQLite Driver for Go

## Mission
To build a pure Go SQLite driver engineered for mission-critical, high-performance environments. The driver will be a secure, portable, and dependency-free component suitable for use in massively parallel, hyper-scale architectures.

## Governing Pillars

1.  **Hyper-Scale Architecture Support:**
    *   The driver is designed as a component for sharded, distributed systems.
    *   Features first-class support for WAL-based replication, enabling continuous data streaming and recovery.

2.  **Extreme Performance Optimizations:**
    *   **Asynchronous I/O:** Leverages advanced kernel interfaces on Linux for maximum throughput.
    *   **Vectorized Execution (SIMD):** The VDBE operates on batches of data for CPU-level parallelism.
    *   **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation:** Hot queries are compiled to native machine code.
    *   **Zero-Allocation Design:** A strict focus on minimizing memory allocations in hot paths.

3.  **Military-Grade Security & Reliability:**
    *   **Formal Verification:** Transaction logic will be mathematically proven correct using rigorous formal methods.
    *   **Fuzz Testing:** A continuous fuzzing suite will run against the parser to prevent security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Sandboxing:** A swappable, sandboxed VFS enforces the Principle of Least Privilege.
    *   **Secure Supply Chain:** Automated SBOM generation and vulnerability scanning.

4.  **Mission-Critical Delivery:**
    *   Every milestone is delivered as complete, production-ready code. **No stubs, no shortcuts, no deferred work.**

## Current Status (Phase 3 Complete)

**Phase 2: The SQL Frontend (Hardened)**
*   **Zero-Trust Tokenizer & Parser:** Implemented with input validation (query length, character set) and robust error handling.
*   **Fuzz Testing Framework:** Basic fuzzing harness in place with panic and error checking.

**Phase 3: Vectorized (SIMD) VDBE & Hardened Opcodes**
*   **Vectorized Execution Model:** Initial VDBE core (`vdbe.go`) implemented with columnar data representation and basic vectorized arithmetic and comparison operations (`OP_Add`, `OP_Subtract`, `OP_Multiply`, `OP_Divide`, `OP_Eq`, `OP_Ne`, `OP_Lt`, `OP_Le`, `OP_Gt`, `OP_Ge`).
*   **Constant-Time & Zero-Allocation Execution:** Conceptual hardened opcode example (`vdbe_opcodes_hardened.go`) demonstrating principles of zero-allocation and constant-time algorithms.

## How to Use (Conceptual)

This project is currently under active development. Once complete, `gosqlite` will provide a `database/sql` compatible driver for Go applications.

**Example (Future):**

```go
package main

import (
	"database/sql"
	"fmt"
	_ "github.com/your-repo/gosqlite" // Import the driver
)

func main() {
	db, err := sql.Open("gosqlite", "file:test.db?cache=shared&mode=rwc")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error opening database:", err)
		return
	}
	defer db.Close()

	// Example usage (conceptual)
	_, err = db.Exec("CREATE TABLE users (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, age INTEGER)")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error creating table:", err)
		return
	}

	res, err := db.Exec("INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES (?, ?)", "Alice", 30)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error inserting data:", err)
		return
	}
	lastId, _ := res.LastInsertId()
	rowCnt, _ := res.RowsAffected()
	fmt.Printf("ID: %d, Affected: %d\n", lastId, rowCnt)

	rows, err := db.Query("SELECT id, name, age FROM users WHERE age > ?", 25)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error querying data:", err)
		return
	}
	defer rows.Close()

	for rows.Next() {
		var id int
		var name string
		var age int
		if err := rows.Scan(&id, &name, &age); err != nil {
			fmt.Println("Error scanning row:", err)
			return
		}
		fmt.Printf("ID: %d, Name: %s, Age: %d\n", id, name, age)
	}
	if err := rows.Err(); err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error iterating rows:", err)
	}
}
```

## Who it is for

`gosqlite` is designed for developers and organizations that require:
*   **Mission-critical database operations** with extreme reliability and security.
*   **High-performance data processing** leveraging modern CPU architectures.
*   **Pure Go solutions** without external C dependencies for enhanced portability and secure supply chains.
*   **Scalable architectures** that can benefit from a driver designed for sharded and distributed systems.
*   **Applications requiring protection against side-channel attacks** and other advanced security threats.
